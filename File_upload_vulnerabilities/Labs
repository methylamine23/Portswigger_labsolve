method 3:
Web shell upload via path traversal:
-sometimes when we upload a php file, the application allows  the file but it prints the content of that file as plain text as a line of defence.
-here the avatar directory is much sanitized, so we'll try to execute our file one or two directory before that..
-upload shell
-send that req to burp repeater 
-you'll see that our shell content got printed instead of executing
-try ../ and send 
-filename="..%2fexploit.php"
-file not found
-url encode the ../ and add it to shell.php
